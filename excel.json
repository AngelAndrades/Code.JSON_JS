This survey aims to: (1) Serve as a national surveillance system to document prevalence and trends over time in suicidal behavior across the life of a Veteran and (2) Provide estimates of the impact of risk and protective factors (e.g., social determinants of health, social capital, and interpersonal needs) on suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts among Veterans. This project will focus on the Veteran population as a whole, not only those using VHA services, and will inform policy and service development, and improve the quality of Veteran suicide prevention programs. The software program used for the ASCEND project is called Mirah. Mirah is a survey administration, measurement feedback and data collection system designed specifically for Measurement Based Care (MBC) in the behavioral health space. The SaaS application is HIPAA compliant and enables health care providers to easily and flexibly administer measures of mental health and overall well-being. Mirah tracks response rates, automatically scores completed measures, and delivers real-time feedback reports. Through serial administration of measures, Mirah can track patient symptoms and distill response data into clinical insights.",

In addition, VA may also bill and collect co-pays from a number of Veterans who receive non-service-connected care or prescriptions from VA medical facilities. VHA established Chief Business Office (CBO) in 2002 to the processes to bill and collect, provide corporate oversight, and further professionalize healthcare revenue activities. Since 2003, CBO's POWER reporting system (POWER/POWER PLUS) has supported VHA's efforts to improve performance in its revenue collections business operations by providing accurate, reliable, and up-to-date outcome and performance measure information. The performance information in POWER/POWER Plus has allowed VHA management to create reports to manage, analyze, and monitor metrics for revenue tracking, yielding over $3 billion per year. The performance of this system and its reporting capabilities are critical to maximizing revenue collections. Inconsistency or variation of data will negatively impact revenue collections, which would result in a reduction of funding provided to VA medical centers and ultimately negatively impact the Veterans with regard to obtaining healthcare service. Therefore, it is critical to maintain technical expertise and continuity of services to reduce variation in reporting and minimize the risk for inconsistent and/or inaccurate data analyzed by high echelon Government personnel and utilized in budgetary planning and decision-making as well as revenue collection. Over the years, dependency on the POWER/POWER Plus reports has grown. In order to keep up with the demand of emerging requirements and management's need for transparency, CBO needs to expand and enhance the current system. POWER/POWER Plus is resting on a legacy platform and outdated software.  This system will be replacing PowerPlus #1505. In order to provide for expansion, accurate and reliable information, the Business Information Office (BIO) has begun creating a new enhanced reporting tool (mPOWER) in a Cloud environment.  Infrastructure project is BIO Business Intelligence Solution (BIO BIS).",

It also captures the departmental space associated with owned and leased sites, as well as the Facility Condition Assessment (FCA) data for each owned building and structure. The system is web-based and is utilized by 1,500+ users across the Department, generally engineering, capital planners, and other facility related staff.In response to Executive Order (EO) 13327, VA reports annually to OMB and the General Services Administration on the Department's inventory and real property performance as defined below:- Federal Real Property Council Inventory Data- Annual Facility Performance Metrics- Facility Utilization Index- Facility Condition Index- Annual Facility Operating Costs- Mission DependencyThis EO broadly refers to promoting the efficient and economical use of America's real property assets and assuring management accountability thereof. Its implementation in the VA enables top leadership to make decisions on construction of future medical centers and disposal of unused buildings, as the veteran population shifts, among other things.  CAMS and CAI are the IT systems used to record and store that data, and generate reports for internal customers, Federal agencies, and the US Congress.  NOTE: CAMS is an umbrella term used by OI&T to group systems such as CAI and CAMS-BI together – there is no physical software directly called “CAMS”.",

At DoD, medical records and patient health care histories are stored in the Clinical Data Repository (CDR), a component of the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA). Similarly, the VA Health Data Repository (HDR) stores data from CHDR and the transactional clinical data from all 128 VistA applications for select clinical domains. CHDR is the link between the two repositories and once the patient is marked active ? data exchange can begin. Data exchange does not occur until ADC activation. CHDR facilitates the sharing of a Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) between DoD and the VA for our nation's Veterans. This enables the VA/VHA to provide a comprehensive integrated medical record that is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and other privacy regulations, and to facilitate a seamless transition from military to Veteran status. CHDR works in the background to deliver improved information sharing between the DoD and VA of medical records for Active Dual Consumers (ADC) patients. The interoperability provides clinical users at DoD and VA medical facilities with bidirectional, real-time exchange of medical records that will include, at a minimum, the exchange of outpatient pharmacy and drug allergies (limited only to drug allergies) to enable drug/drug and drug/allergy order checks. The integrated clinical data between the DoD and the VA (outpatient pharmacy and drug allergy data) can be viewed in VistAWeb or CPRS Remote Data Views (RDV).",

This application is currently hosted in Region 1, with deployment to a limited population. This project will expand availability to a national audience. The tool was originally developed by the Atlanta VAMC and upgraded to a web-based application by the Portland Innovation Center, to assist Non-VA Care Coordination (NVCC) staff with producing documents in support of the Community Care and Veterans Choice Programs (VCP). The tool provides end-users, i.e., VHA medical, clinical and admin staff, with the ability to generate electronically a consolidated PDF file that contains information relevant to the Veteran’s community-care appointment such as patient demographics, Choice authorization (VHA Form 10-0386), consult, progress notes, medication list, lab work, and imaging results. To provide external Community Care Program providers timely information on veterans entrusted to their care, this system automates and digitizes a manual process for extracting this information from at least five different hard-copy (printed) sources. Pulling data directly from VA databases, this application populates and generates single PDF file with all of this information. It features a web-based interface for access from anywhere. It is currently in use on a regional basis. This project will elevate it to national deployment as a Class 1 application. This project transitions the platform from a regional server to a world-class hosting EO (EWIS) environment that has the resources and infrastructure to ensure high availability, performance, security, disaster/recovery and timely and effective maintenance. The new hosting platform will provide virtual servers for development, testing, staging/pre-production and production. The regional development team will continue to develop and release new functionality in iterations of monthly or quarterly sprints, until alternate arrangements are made at the national level.",

The President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors (Dole/Shalala) established by Executive Order 13426 in March 2007 recommended the creation of a My eBenefits (a.k.a. eBenefits) web portal to provide the wounded, injured and ill service members/Veterans, their families and care providers a single sign-on, central access point to online benefits and related services. The eBenefits portal is a one-stop shop for benefits-related online tools and information. The portal is designed for Wounded Warriors, Veterans, Service members, their families, and those who care for them. eBenefits provides two main services. It's a catalog of links to information on other websites about military and Veteran benefits. And it provides a personalized workspace called My eBenefits which gives quick access to all the online tools now integrated into eBenefits - tools that let you do things like apply for benefits, download your DD 214, and see your benefits status online. Service members, Veterans, and family members can register for eBenefits, which affords access to the secure features in My eBenefits and allows the portal to personalized to the user's needs. You must be enrolled in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) to create an account. The EVSS is a portal platform that supports interactions between VA and Veterans through the streamlining of access to self service capabilities, and improvements to the processes used to identify and grant access to the VA's Veterans and Dependents (Members) and those providing services on behalf of the Veteran (Providers).",

Participating Veterans Affairs Medical Center staff enter information into FSOD on-line through a software program called VA FIMware (Functional Independence Measurement (FIM)). Users throughout the VA can access stored FSOD data through VA FIMware. Quarterly, FSOD data is transferred electronically to the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation (UDSmr) server in Buffalo, New York. The UDSmr database contains a U.S. national roll-up of rehabilitative programs. Users include all VA personnel involved in rehabilitative care and the UDSmr.",

It improves tools that Care Coordination nurses use to manage their panel of patients enrolled in the Home Telehealth program. The data from the tools are used by VHA to assess and improve Home Telehealth program outcomes and allows for updates to the system architecture to maintain security of Veteran data. HTRE supports the Home Telehealth program in improving clinical outcomes and access to care by reducing complications, hospitalizations, and clinic or emergency room visits for veterans who are at high risk due to a chronic disease. The enhancements will help veterans continue to live independently and spend less time at medical visits while providing veterans the knowledge and skills needed to more effectively self-manage their own health care needs. is a Web-based portal application sponsored by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Telehealth Services (OTS).",

The original IRIS was a very basic pilot application that was developed as a sidebar to the Veteran-Focused Internet Redesign Project of 2001; it was replaced in November 2002 by a customized version of a commercial product known as RightNow Technologies E-Service Center. This application is an official System of Records that provides VA customers with secure communication of personal data, should they voluntarily choose to send it to VA; it has been customized over time to meet the needs of VA and its Veterans and other external users and is upgraded periodically to optimize and improve its functionality and utility.VA has a worldwide customer base that demands information and services 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Veteran and other customer traffic to VA’s web site continues to increase, clearly demonstrating the utility of the web site for providing robust customer service to our veterans, business partners, and other customers. IRIS allows customers to self-direct a question, suggestion, compliment, complaint, request for a status of claim or appeal, or any other question to the appropriate VA office. VBA call centers also use the IRIS to record and route inquiries that are received by telephone and which the call center agents are unable to answer in real time while on those calls. The system provides a mechanism by which VA management can track the number of inquiries received through the IRIS vehicle and the response time in providing customer service to our inquirers, along with providing other quality control features for VA managers.Usage of the IRIS has grown exponentially since its inception; currently, the IRIS system handles approximately 50,000 inquiries per month and has 475 mailgroups across VA, including all VBA Regional Offices, all VA Medical Centers and VISN Offices, all branches of the National Cemetery Administration, the E-Benefits Help Desk, the MyHealtheVet help desk staff, and numerous other entities/mailgroups. Components of the commercial product were adapted to VA's use and include: the department's Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Knowledge Base that must be populated and maintained by appropriate designated VA staff;, the ability to receive and respond to veteran inquiries; the ability to track inquiries, turnaround time, and other statistical data; an extensive reports capability to generate reports with useful information to VA's IRIS community and VA management.This website publishes to the VA Intranet the documents associated with the RightNow application implementation plus instruction guides and a monthly summary of IRIS inquiry receipts.",

The ICB Graphical User Interface (GUI) is integrated with several Vista components such as Appointment Scheduling and the Patient Insurance File. ICB allows users to easily view and update information stored within the VistA insurance company and veteran insurance file database. ICB provides intake staff an electronic list of veterans with scheduled appointments whose insurance requires verification prior to the appointment. The “Patient Update” worklist is used by check-in/check-out and registration clerks to scan insurance cards for those identified on the list. The worklist displays according to clinic configurations according to the specific user profile. Scanned images are stored in an IT specified server folder and are immediately accessible to insurance verification clerks via the “Insurance Buffer Entries” list. Data from the image can be compared to existing insurance data within the veteran’s permanent insurance file in VistA. A reporting utility is available to Business Office managers to ensure the compliance of Entry Clerks and insurance verification personnel with this initiative. VHA Directive 1910 mandates the use of ICB for requesting and verifying insurance information. As Entry Clerks populate the insurance buffer via the ICB software, the electronic Insurance Verification (eIV) VistA software automatically sends and receives electronic inquiries in real-time from available third-party payers. These Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) functions are in compliance with HIPAA mandated industry standards. The resulting electronic response can auto-update to the patient file or is available for insurance verification staff processing.",

The goal of UML is to implement audit and correction systems to ensure the timely and proper billing of prescriptions subject to special eligibilities. The use of machine learning to identify billing errors has been reduced to practice using an augmented pharmacist tertiary review. The next phase is to emphasize automation to aid in the just and ethical application of prescription benefits and integration of recommender systems into the electronic health records.",

Increase the quality of the services to our Veterans by providing a means to develop consistency in services, review prescription and management practices, develop training, monitor Home Medical Equipment, and measure performance improvements. Reduce costs by comparing costs system-wide, identifying common items for consolidated contracting, identifying costs for Medical Cost Care Funds (MCCF) purposes and improving contracting cost benefit. Improve efficiency by validating the data, improving budget management, determining where coding errors occur, providing training, and comparing unique social security numbers for multiple site usage and item issue. The NPPD Menu provides patient information, patient eligibility, Prosthetic treatment, date of provision, cost, vendor, and purchasing agent information. This system tracks average cost data and its usage and provides on both a monthly and quarterly basis detailed and summary reports by station, Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) and agency. The NPPD Menu resides in Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) at the medical center level. This data is updated quarterly. Data is rolled up at each facility and transmitted to Hines. The data is then loaded into the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) from which data extracts are done. The data is also put into a ProClarity cube and is available to VA local, regional, and national managers online. National managers have the ability to properly monitor, oversee and manage the national program and regional managers are able to effectively manage their respective areas using this tool.

This enhancement has led to a change in the system name to reflect the additional functionality. The system is now known as the Standards and COTS Integration Platform (SCIP). SCIP is a middleware hardware and software framework that provides a secure, bidirectional, real-time interagency exchange of clinical data and patient demographics between VA and DoD health information systems. Hosted within the SCIP enclave, each with a unique interagency data sharing purpose are the following systems: SCIP Framework, SCIP Station 200, and interagency image sharing functions. The SCIP Framework middleware systems consist of various components and applications that pass unclassified patient data bidirectionally between VA and DoD. Some of the key components of the SCIP Framework include: External communication adapter (XCA), Doc Search XCA, XCA Data Services, Clinical/Health Data Repository (CHDR) Active Dual Consumer (ADC) Feed, etc. This Interagency functionality is implemented at an enterprise level and deployed globally. VistA is the end-user interface for VA. SCIP was upgraded to provide the current middleware that facilitates the transfer of clinical information from the DoD’s Essentris system, Clinical Data Repository (CDR) and the Theater Medical Data Store (TMDS) to the VA’s Computerized Patient Record Service (CPRS) Remote Data Views (RDV) and VistAWeb. This project added improved functionality for VA clinicians to view DoD inpatient data via the VA CPRS RDV Graphical User Interface (GUI) and now includes medical images as of FY2008 and beyond in other Government projects. Subsequent SCIP enhancements further improved SCIP functionality to support additional data types and data sources such as numerous Secure Healthcare Alliance Record Exchange (SHARE) sites, Health Artifact and Image Management Solution (HAIMS), and Central VistA Imaging Exchange (CVIX). SCIP is hosted at CRRC in Martinsburg, WV, while its Alternate Processing Site (APS) is located at SRDC in Secaucus, NJ.",

    "description": "The Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) tool supports the Department’s long-range capital planning process. It is a data driven process, designed to provide a full plan to address the department’s service and infrastructure related gaps, across all Administrations and Staff Offices, covering all capital programs. The SCIP process results in both a long-range plan and resource requirements to address all known gaps and an integrated, current year project listing that is prioritized to support VA’s annual budget request. The SCIP Automated Tool (SAT) is a web-based IT application used to support the SCIP process. The SAT houses all of the service and infrastructure related gap information that drives the SCIP process. From that gap data, the SAT supports the development of the long-range plan (referred to as the Action Plan) and the specific projects to be considered for inclusion in the VA budget submission (referred to as the Business Case). There are more than 2,500 users of the SAT, most from the various VA Medical Centers across the country. The tool also supports the prioritization process for SCIP Business Cases which results in the fully single, department wide integrated list of projects across all capital programs. Lastly, SAT supports Budget Execution, through the creation and monitoring of Operating Plans and Out of Cycle project requests. The SAT is a comprehensive tool that supports the SCIP process from end to end, providing a single repository for VA’s capital planning and project related information.",

    "description": "[On 04/05/2019, determined to decommission after unsuccessful attempt to find any viable POC to obtain information. ]On January 16, 2009, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a final rule for replacing the 30-year-old ICD-9-CM code set with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) with dates of service, or date of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or after October 1, 2013. The classification system consists of more than 68,000 codes, compared to approximately 13,000 ICD-9-CM codes. There are nearly 87,000 ICD-10-PCS codes, while ICD-9-CM has nearly 3,800 procedure codes. Both systems also expand the number of characters allotted from five and four respectively to seven alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set. These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical decision making and outcomes research. Currently, the ICD-9-CM code set is used for the recording and reporting of clinical diagnoses, injuries, and procedures. Diagnosis codes are contained in Volumes 1 and 2 of ICD-9-CM and are used in outpatient and inpatient settings. Volume 3 includes procedure codes used in the inpatient setting. ICD-10-CM will replace ICD-9-CM as the diagnostic coding system. ICD-10-CM will provide the official coding guidelines for coding diseases, injuries, impairments, other health problems and their manifestations, and causes of injury, disease, impairment, or other problems. Unlike its predecessor, it does not include procedure codes. ICD-10-PCS will replace the ICD-9-CM procedural coding system. It will provide the official coding guidelines for procedures and other actions taken for diseases, injuries, and impairments on inpatients reported by hospitals. This includes prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management. ICD-10-PCS will only be used for facility reporting of hospital inpatient procedures and will not affect the use of the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) Level II coding systems (as these systems are used to report physician and other professional services as well as procedures performed in hospital outpatient departments or other outpatient facilities). This request, when implemented, will allow the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to accommodate the entry, display, lookup, view, print, storage, and transmission of the ICD-10-code sets in the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) legacy and HealtheVet systems. Furthermore, it seeks to identify technology/areas that must be developed to support minimal disruption to current business processes for this conversion. There will be a period of time when VHA would require the use of dual code sets (ICD-9 and ICD-10) to accommodate outpatient dates of service and inpatient discharges prior to and following the compliance date (10/1/13) as well as for reporting and research purposes. Additionally, VHA will not accommodate business partners that are not prepared by the mandated ICD-10 implementation date. Effective October 1, 2013, VHA would be able to utilize the ICD-10 code set in its day-to-day operations (e.g. entry, display, lookup, print, storage, internal and/or external transmission) for outpatient dates of service and inpatient discharges on or after this date.",

Frequently performed other types of surgeries may also be excluded. Nurse reviewers at VAMCs gather the information from surgical data located in the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment. Information is also collected from pre-and post-operative charts and from interviews with patients. This information is entered into VistA and transmitted daily by a batch process to the Hines Office of Information & Technology (OI&T) Field Office. While the database has been in operation since 1995, the system only contains data for the current fiscal year. The data from previous fiscal years is archived if later retrieval is needed. Valid transmissions are sent to the VASQIP office at Denver for analysis. Information from non-assessed surgeries is transmitted from the VAMCs to the Hines OI Field Office monthly. This is also passed along to VASQIP at Denver. The users of this database include the VASQIP Executive Board.",

These reports help improve the ability to trend and analyze accidental injuries and illnesses, thus helping to prevent future incidents from occurring; 2) Reduce exposures to bloodborne pathogens from needlesticks, sharps, or body fluids. The ASISTS instantly notifies Occupational Health and other medical personnel when the employee reports an incident involving a blood borne pathogen exposure, so that proper tests and treatment can be initiated. The data concerning exposure to bloodborne pathogens will be collected in a national database to identify national trends, training needs and best practices for the benefit of all employees at every VA medical center; 3) Reduce worker compensation costs. ASISTS facilitates a case management approach to preventing future accidents and will provide better management of workers' compensation claims. Through automation, the CA-1 and the CA-2 forms will be more accurate and be processed in a more timely fashion.",

VA library staff spend the largest share of local materials budgets on serials. The process of ordering, tracking, claiming, and listing these titles is tedious and error-prone when done manually. Automation of serials management allows a faster and more accurate process for work simplification. Library management is assisted through improved statistics and information. Staff is able to use Library Patron options to see whether the local Library Service owns a journal title and, if so, the holdings and location for that title. The Serials Control module has three components. The Serials Management component creates the local library's serials database, along with retrospective holdings and purchasing information and copy information, such as location and category. The module is designed so that access to this component may be restricted, if desired, to the serials expert on the library staff, usually a medical librarian or the Chief. Access to the Serials Control component where daily actions are managed (e.g., check-ins, routing, and generation of reports) may be given to other Library Service staff members. A minor component of the module, Library Site Parameters, allows for the initialization of the module. Library makes it possible for local sites to carry only locally active entries in their local database.

The Enhanced Time and Attendance (ETA) System, a component of PAID, automates time and attendance for employees, timekeepers, payroll, and supervisors.  It provides employees the ability to request leave and display both the status of pending requests and leave balances and allows payroll to manage time and leave (T&amp;L) units and tours of duty.  As the official record keeping system for time and attendance within the VA, it provides timekeeping, supervisory certification, and overtime management. The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 [Public Law 111-292, House Resolution (H.R.) 1772] requires government agencies to establish a policy under which eligible employees may be authorized to telework to the maximum extent that is possible without diminishing performance, determine employee eligibility to participate in telework, and notify all employees of their eligibility to telework.  Agencies are also required to provide training to teleworkers and ensure that no distinction is made between those who chose to telecommute and those who don’t in the areas of performance and training.  OPM would be required to provide regulations and assistance regarding teleworking.",

It provides for multiple-appointment booking, which enables the user to schedule, at one time, numerous appointments on a consecutive day/week basis. This pattern of scheduling supports requirements for clinics such as dialysis treatment and physical therapy. The system may display numerous messages when an appointment is scheduled depending on the availability of the slot requested.  These include notification that the appointment is an overbook, the patient already has an appointment scheduled for that date and time, or the appointment cannot be made due to previous inactivation of the designated clinic. In addition, certain classification questions are prompted during the check-out process (if applicable) to determine if treatment rendered was connected to special circumstances (such as Agent Orange, Ionizing Radiation, Persian Gulf, etc.). If an appointment cannot be scheduled because of limitations, the user is prompted to add the appointment information to a Wait List for future scheduling. Patient Appointment Information gathers appointment data to be loaded into the National Database in Austin for statistical reporting. Patient appointments are scanned from September 1, 2002 to the present, and appointment data meeting specified criteria are transmitted to the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC). Subsequent transmissions will update the National Database. This additional data supplements the existing Clinic Appointment Wait Time extracts.

Many steps were involved because national data was only consolidated once a month and it was usually out of sync.

Rehosted VSS uses .NET technology that replaced data transmissions between sites and the Austin Information Technology Center to produce the consolidated national reports.

WRAP also controls a users ability to access the system via scheduling functions and access limitations.

User Profiles also control the categories that a user can work on or view, and the profile can only be updated by a Supervisor.
